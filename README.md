# OverlayPlugin

Plugin to show customizable overlays for Advanced Combat Tracker.

## Download

You can download release and pre-release archives from the [release page][releases].

## System requirements

* .NET Framework 4.7.1
* MS Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019

## How to use

To use this plugin, add `OverlayPlugin.dll` in ACT's plugin tab. It can not be moved around alone, as the files around it are important.

In ACT, go to the `Plugins` tab and then to the `OverlayPlugin.dll` tab. You'll find all overlay related settings there.

Example HTML files are in the `resources` folder.

We also have [instructions for users who want to display their overlay in OBS](https://overlayplugin.github.io/OverlayPlugin/streamers).

## How to build

These instructions are only relevant to you if you want to modify the plugin. To install it, go to the [release page][releases] instead.

* Install Visual Studio 2019 (earlier versions might work as well but haven't been tested) and the .NET desktop workload through its installer
* Checkout source codes with git, or download source code as ZIP and extract.
* Run `tools/fetch_deps.py`
* Run `build.bat`

Once finished, the plugin file `OverlayPlugin.dll` will appear in the `out` folder. It will either be in the `Release` or `Debug` subfolder depending on which configuration you built.
